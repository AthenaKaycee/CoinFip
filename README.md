This a coin flip simulator where you choose heads or tails, it will tell you if you are right or wrong.

Right now it does not work at the moment I am planing on adding a count button to let you know how many times you have flipped the coin 
I'm also going add sound to it to let you whether you go it right or not like a guessing game.
